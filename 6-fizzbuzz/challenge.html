    <h1>Challenge: FizzBuzz</h1>
    <p>The young campers are playing a game where they count from 1 to 100 one number at a time. For each number:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the number is divisible by 3, they say "Fizz"</li>
      <li>If the number is divisible by 5, they say "Buzz"</li>
      <li>If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, they say "FizzBuzz"</li>
      <li>If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, they say the number</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For instance, here's how a game might go:</p>
    <pre>
      1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, 5, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, 17, Fizz ... 97, 98, Fizz, Buzz
    </pre>
    <p>Implement a program that simulates a game of FizzBuzz using JavaScript</p>
    <h2>Hints</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What programming construct can be used to count up and execute code many times?</li>
      <li>What operator returns the remainder of a division operation? How do you use it to check divisibility?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Take It Further</h2>
    <p>The campers get bored easily, so they want to mix up the rules a bit. They might:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Change the number they start counting at</li>
      <li>Change the number they count up to</li>
      <li>Change the amount of numbers they count up each turn</li>
      <li>Add or remove divisibility rules
        <ul>
          <li>Remove 3 and "Fizz"</li>
          <li>Add 7 and "Bark"</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>You don't want to make manual modifications to the code every time the rules change. How would you update your code to handle these conditions for future runs?</p>
    <p>Hint: how could you utilize function parameters and/or an object literal to make this possible?</p>
